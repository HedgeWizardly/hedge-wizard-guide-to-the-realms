# Spirit Idol

Necromancy

Level: **4**
Casting time: **1 Action**
Range: **60 feet**
Components: **V, S, M (a small doll or figurine)**
Duration: **1 minute**

You manifest a portion of a creature's spirit. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, you summon a manifestation of the creature's spirit as a spirit idol within 60 feet of you, at a point of your choosing.

A target’s spirit idol resembles its body in almost every way, but looks like a ghostly spirit. The spirit idol is non-corporeal and cannot be moved in any way. It has an AC of 13, and 30 hit points. Attacks against the spirit idol cannot benefit from advantage or disadvantage. It is immune to non-magical damage, and automatically fails all saving throws. 

Any other effects that apply to a spirit idol have no effect on the target’s body and vice versa. If a target’s body or spirit idol drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for the target if you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or if the creature moves further than 120 feet away from its spirit idol. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spirit idol's hit points increase by 10 for each slot level above 4th.
