# Juniper's Many Hands


You manifest up to four visibly spectral floating hands in your space. The hands remain in your space and last for the duration or until you dismiss one or all of them as an action. The hands can’t attack, cast spells, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds, even when working together. 

You can use your action to mentally instruct the hands to perform tasks as suggested in the table below, as long as you know how to do them. The hands carry out the task to the best of their ability until it is complete, or until you mentally command them to stop (no action required). You may also use the hands to assist in something you may be doing with your own hands, potentially reducing the amount of the time it takes to complete the task (at the GM's discretion). Some mages consider these hands to be an extension of themselves, whereas others may treat them as spectral servants to be given tasks. Work with your GM to determine which style is most appropriate for your character and campaign.

For the purposes of multi-tasking with this spell, you are considered to have a Focus score equal to 1 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, which is split amongst anything you are attempting to do at once, whether you are using the spell to do it or not. Examples of tasks you can perform are detailed in the table below, along with their complexity ranking and Focus requirement. Simple tasks can usually be performed with just one of the hands, but intermediate and advanced tasks require two or more. If you do something which would cause you to exceed your Focus score, you must pause one of the other tasks, or the spell will end. Holding a simple object does not require any Focus.

A caster with a spellcasting ability modifier of 3 would have a Focus score of 4, and could perform four simple tasks, two intermediate tasks, or one simple and one advanced task simultaneously. Skilled spellcasters may use the spell to braid their hair while applying makeup, nurse a mug of tea while writing in a book, play two instruments in a one-person band, or pet up to 6 friendly creatures at once.
Task Complexity	Focus Cost	Examples
Simple	1	Manipulate a simple object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a water vial.
Intermediate	2	Tasks with some combined level of intricacy and repetition, such as tying shoelaces, braiding hair, folding clothes, or mending simple items.
Advanced	3	Tasks that usually require a proficiency, such as playing a musical instrument, partaking in a card game, or picking a pocket.
