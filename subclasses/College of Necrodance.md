# College of Necrodancing

In some worlds, Necromancy can be broken up into three core specialties: the soul, the mind, and the body. The soul is often associated with life-force and vitality; The mind with communicating what a creature knew in life; The body with its muscle memory and learned habits. 

It is this third specialty of the body that Necrodancers tap into with their irresistible beats, melodies, and movements. They cause the spiritual corpus to re-animate using the same impulses that set a head bobbing or a foot tapping. 

While not fully understood, some magical scholars believe Necrodancing to be one of the few "ethical" ways to practice Necromancy, as the soul and body can be left in peace, while the spiritual corpus can be made to inhabit inanimate objects, and can operate without any connection to the departed. 

If this aligns with your world, you may find individuals with a rare knack for Necrodancing, and the soul for getting down...


## Infectious Rhythm
Level 3:
As a bonus action, you can expend a bardic inspiration to imbue a creature with sensational groove, choosing one of the below effects. The effect lasts for up to one minute, or until you use this feature again.

- The creature’s movement speed increases or decreases by 10 feet (your choice). This does not stack with the effects of Irrepressible Dance.

- The creature has disadvantage on dexterity checks and saving throws

- The creature has advantage on performance checks and saving throws to avoid being frightened

- The creature expends 15 feet of movement immediately, and then again on each consecutive turn while affected. If it does so, its AC increases by 1.

Unwilling creatures can make a saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. Once a creature succeeds on this save, they cannot be effected again until the next dawn.

Undead creatures automatically fail this save.


## Animating Performance

At 6th level, you learn the animate dead spell if you do not know it already, and it is always prepared. When you cast animate dead, you can choose to target a Large or smaller non-magical item that is not being carried or worn, which uses the Dancing Item stat block, benefitting from your proficiency bonus (PB). Additionally, you can target one additional corpse,  pile of bones, or object- creating another zombie, skeleton, or Dancing Item as appropriate. 

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:
*   The creature's dexterity score is increased by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier
* The creature’s AC is equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency
*   The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

Additionally, the following effects apply:
- The creature is incapable of staying completely still. This may manifest in foot tapping, head bobbing, finger clicking, or full blown dancing.
- The creature will disanimate if it cannot see or hear you, or if it is more than 90 feet away from you.


## Some Witty Groovy Name
Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other casters. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your bard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.

If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
