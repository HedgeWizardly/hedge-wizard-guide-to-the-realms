# Warrior of Mercury
*Harness Supernatural Speed and Reflexes*

Warriors of Mercury are some of the fastest creatures alive. They hone their bodies to perform incredible feats of speed to enhance attacks, avoid blows, and travel incredible distances in the blink of an eye.

## Level 3: Need For Speed
Your speed increases by 10 feet. It increases by 10 feet again at levels 6, 11, and 17.

When you make a long jump, you can cover an additional 5 feet for every 15 feet you moved on foot immediately before the jump.

## Level 3: Terminal Velocity
Whenever you hit a creature with an attack immediately after moving at least 15 feet in a straight line towards them, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.

_**Impact.**_ The target takes additional damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die.

_**Push.**_ The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

_**Topple.**_ The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition

## Level 6: Blink of an Eye

Your speed makes it almost impossible for even the most perceptive creatures to see you run. Whenever you use Step of the Wind to move at least 10 feet, you can spend 1 Focus point to move so quickly that you appear almost instantaneously at your destination. Creatures cannot perceive you between your starting point and your destination, and you gain the benefits of the Disengage action.

## Level 11: Quicksilver Technique
When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.
