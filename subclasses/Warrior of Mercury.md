# Warrior of Mercury
*Harness Supernatural Speed and Reflexes*

Warriors of Mercury are some of the fastest creatures alive. They hone their bodies to perform incredible feats of speed to enhance attacks, avoid blows, and travel incredible distances in the blink of an eye.

## Level 3: Quicksilver Stride
Your speed increases by 10 feet. It increases by 10 feet again at levels 6, 11, and 17.

When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to your Dexterity score for every 10 feet of movement spent immediately before the jump. You must have enough movement left to spend on your turn in order to reach this extended distance, and this jump distance cannot exceed 30 feet.

## Level 3: Bullet Punch

If you move at least 15 feet in a straight line towards your target on your turn before making an Unarmed Strike or an attack with a Monk weapon, your first attack deals bonus Force damage equal to one third of the distance travelled (rounded down), if you hit.

## Level 3: Shockwave

As an Action after moving at least 20 feet in a straight line, you expend any remaining movement you have on your turn. You can force every creature within 10 feet to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, creatures take damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die + your Dexterity modifier, and are knocked back up to 15 feet away from you.

When you reach 11th level, creatures take half as much damage from this feature on a successful saving throw.

## Level 6: Blink of an Eye

Your speed makes it almost impossible for even the most perceptive creatures to see you run. When you use Step of the Wind to move at least 15 feet, you can choose to move so quickly that you appear to teleport to your location. Creatures cannot make opportunity attacks on you, or perceive you between your starting point and your destination.

## Level 11: Fleet Step

When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action. [1](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/monk:warrior-of-the-open-hand)

## Level 17: Time in a Bottle

You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. The first is taken at the top of the round, and the second on your Initiative. [2](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/rogue:thief)
